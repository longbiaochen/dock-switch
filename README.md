## Installation
* Download the latest release version: https://github.com/longbiaochen/dock-switch/releases


## Build from source
1. `git clone ${this-repo}`
2. `cd dock-switch; electron-builder; sudo ./install.sh;`

``/app/ui-helper`` is a pre-built binary from this repo: https://github.com/longbiaochen/ui-helper


## Note
* You can use [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements) to map any key to ``F20``
* For the first time use, go to ``System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy`` tab, unlock and tick for ``dock-switch.app`` 
* You will need to allow apps from ``unidentified developer (i.e., me)`` several times during installation, because I didn't pay [the Apple Tax](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Apple%20Tax).
